I have macbook and also have a ubuntu desktop.

I have gpg key on my macbook first,
so on the macbook:

```
gpg -a --export-secret-key > secret.asc

```

Then on my ubuntu desktop:

```
gpg import secret.asc
```

## Issues

Not sure if it's because mine is M1 macbook.

```
error: gpg failed to sign the data
fatal: failed to write commit object
```
