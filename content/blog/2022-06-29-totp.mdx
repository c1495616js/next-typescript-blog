## Description

We may have already used TOTP ([Time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password)) many times, but wondering what's the theory behind.

## Steps to generate TOTP

- Get Unix Timestamp

```js
const now = new Date();
const unix = now.getTime();
```

- If we want to generate different TOTP every `60` seconds, then we could get the integer part by `unix / 60`.

```js
const int = Math.floor(unix / 60);
```

- When you generate TOTP, the website will give you a QRCode to scan, it consists the `secret`.
Let's say secret is like: 

```js
const SECRET = 'ABCDE12345';
```

- Use [HMAC](https://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html) to hash the `int` part and the `secret`.

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');

const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', SECRET)
                   .update(int)
                   .digest('hex');
```

- Convert the `hash` (16-digits) to `10-digits`.

```js
const TOTP10Digits = parseInt(hash, 16);
```

- Get the last 6-digits of `TOTP`

```js
const TOTP = TOTP10Digists % 10^6;
```

## Conclusion

That's it. Very simple. And the website will save the same `secret` as the one on your mobile authenticator app.
And from the algorithm above, you don't need the internet to get the TOTP.
