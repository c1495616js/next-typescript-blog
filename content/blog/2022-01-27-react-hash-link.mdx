## Idea

React-router does not support routing to `#id`.
This npm `react-router-hash-link` is life saver.

## Issue

But got some issue when it routes to the anchor, it might break the UI.
I think it's because of `offset`.

Here is the solution.

```tsx
const scrollWithOffset = (el: HTMLElement) => {
    const yCoordinate = el.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset;
    const yOffset = -80; 
    window.scrollTo({ top: yCoordinate + yOffset, behavior: 'smooth' }); 
}

<NavHashLink smooth to='/#link' scroll={scrollWithOffset}>
     Link
</NavHashLink>
```
