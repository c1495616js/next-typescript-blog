## Idea
To document my learning of Design Pattern in JS.

### S.O.L.I.D

### Gamma Categorization

- Split into 3 categories
- `Creational Patterns`:
  - Deal with the creation(construction) of objects.
  - Explicit(constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs. peicewise (step-by-step)
- `Structural Patterns`:
  - Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
  - Stress the importance of good API design.
- `Behavioral Patterns`: 
  - The are all different; no central theme.
